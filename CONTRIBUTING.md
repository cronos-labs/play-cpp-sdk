# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cronos Play C++ SDK! Good places to start are this document and the materials linked in README. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/crypto-com/play-cpp-sdk/discussions/landing).


## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Feature requests and bug reports

Feature requests and bug reports should be posted as [Github issues](issues/new).
In an issue, please describe what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead.

If you think that you have identified an issue with Cronos Play C++ SDK that might compromise
its users' security, please do not open a public issue on GitHub. Instead,
we ask you to refer to [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Working on issues
There are several ways to identify an area where you can contribute to Cronos Play C++ SDK:

* You can reach out by sending a message in the developer community communication channel, either with a specific contribution in mind or in general by saying "I want to help!".
* Occasionally, some issues on Github may be labelled with `help wanted` or `good first issue` tags.

We use the variation of the "fork and pull" model where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.
Changes in pull requests should satisfy "Patch Requirements" described in [The Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/#23-patch-requirements). The code should follow [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/tree/master/style-guide). Many of the code style rules are captured by [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt), so please make sure to use `cargo fmt` before every commit (e.g. by configuring your editor to do it for you upon saving a file). The code comments should follow [Rust API Documentation guidelines and conventions](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html).

Once you identified an issue to work on, this is the summary of your basic steps:

* Fork Cronos Play C++ SDK's repository under your Github account.

* Clone your fork locally on your machine.

* Post a comment in the issue to say that you are working on it, so that other people do not work on the same issue.

* Create a local branch on your machine by `git checkout -b branch_name`.

* Commit your changes to your own fork -- see [C4 Patch Requirements](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/#23-patch-requirements) for guidelines.

* Include tests that cover all non-trivial code.

* Check you are working on the latest version on main in Cronos Play C++ SDK's official repository. If not, please pull Cronos Play C++ SDK's official repository's main (upstream) into your fork's main branch, and rebase your committed changes or replay your stashed changes in your branch over the latest changes in the upstream version.

* Run all tests locally and make sure they pass.

* If your changes are of interest to other developers, please make corresponding changes in the official documentation and the changelog.

* Push your changes to your fork's branch and open the pull request to Cronos Play C++ SDK's repository main branch.

* In the pull request, complete its checklist, add a clear description of the problem your changes solve, and add the following statement to confirm that your contribution is your own original work: "I hereby certify that my contribution is in accordance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (https://developercertificate.org/)."

* The reviewer will either accept and merge your pull request, or leave comments requesting changes via the Github PR interface (you should then make changes by pushing directly to your existing PR branch).
